And it keeps presidents from controlling elections-including their own reelections. Publisher and former presidential candidate Steve Forbes, Princeton historian Allen Guelzo, and a host of experts explain why we really have the Electoral College, what it does, and what could happen if we got rid of it.",2020-09-09

The first link in the chain is James Benning, one of the world's most patient filmmakers. His extensive plans are replicated in the following fragments.
